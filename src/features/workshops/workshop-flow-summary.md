## API Integration

The frontend flow integrates with the following API endpoints:

1. **Workshop CRUD**
   - POST /workshops
   - GET /workshops
   - GET /workshops/:id
   - PUT /workshops/:id

2. **Production & Hours**
   - POST /workshops/:id/production
   - POST /workshops/:id/hours

3. **Financial**
   - POST /workshops/:id/settlement
   - GET /workshops/:id/summary

4. **Employee Management**
   - POST /workshops/:id/employees/:employeeId
   - DELETE /workshops/:id/employees/:employeeId

## Usage Pattern

```typescript
// Import types, hooks, and services
import { useWorkshops, useCreateWorkshop } from '@/hooks/workshops';
import { Workshop, CreateWorkshopDTO } from '@/types/workshops';
import { WorkshopService } from '@/services/workshops';

// Use in components
const { data: workshops, isLoading } = useWorkshops();
const createWorkshop = useCreateWorkshop();

// Perform operations
createWorkshop.mutate(workshopData);
```

## Next Steps for UI Implementation

1. **Workshop List Component**
   - Display all workshops in a table/grid
   - Show workshop balance and employee count
   - Add filters for work type

2. **Workshop Details Component**
   - Show workshop information
   - Display employees
   - Show production/hours history
   - Financial summary section

3. **Workshop Form Component**
   - Create/edit workshop
   - Validate inputs
   - Handle form submission

4. **Production Entry Component**
   - Select items and quantities
   - Date picker
   - Notes field

5. **Hours Entry Component**
   - Select employee
   - Enter hours and rate
   - Date picker

6. **Settlement Component**
   - Enter amount
   - Select fund
   - Create invoice

7. **Workshop Dashboard**
   - Financial overview
   - Recent activities
   - Performance metrics

## Integration with Existing Modules

The workshop flow integrates seamlessly with:

1. **Employees Module**
   - Employees can be assigned to workshops
   - Work tracking through workshops

2. **Items Module**
   - Production tracking uses items
   - Production rates calculation

3. **Funds Module**
   - Settlements transfer to funds
   - Financial tracking

4. **Invoices Module**
   - Settlements generate invoices
   - Financial documentation

## State Management

Using React Query for:
- Data fetching and caching
- Optimistic updates
- Query invalidation
- Loading and error states

## Type Safety

All operations are fully typed with TypeScript:
- Request/response types
- Hook parameters
- Service methods
- Component props

This ensures type safety throughout the application and prevents runtime errors.
